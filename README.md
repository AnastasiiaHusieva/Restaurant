# Restaurant

DataDine is a restaurant's website where the user can create a profile, add items to their carts and proceed to checkout and check their order status. Administrators have access to both the user and order databases. Admins can also utilize an "Add-food portal" to dynamically add new dishes and place them in the appropriate categories.
